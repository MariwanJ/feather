Feather
=======

3d polygon modeller based off of Wings3d

Introduction
---------------
Feather is 3d polygon modelling application based on Wings3d. Feather has a C++ core and Qt5 QML interface which eliminates issues that Wings has due to the Erlang language that it uses. Feather is currently only targeted for the Linux OS but others could be added later.

Current Status
---------------
Currently Feather is in it's very early stages of development and is pretty much useless. Once the project gets to a point where it's usable (you can open and model, make adjustments and then save your changes) I'll post instructions on how to build and install the application.
