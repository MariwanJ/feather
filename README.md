Introduction
---------------
Feather is 3d polygon modelling application based on Wings3d with some influences from Maya. Feather is currently only targeted for the Linux OS but others could be added later.

Target Features
---------------
Here's a list of features that are the goal for version 1.0.
* C++ core
* QtQuick interface
* Open/Save feather project files
* DAG with field connections between different nodes
* Users can add custom node fields to any node and connect this field to any other field of the same type in another node.
* Plugin architecture
* Import/Export obj files
* Full clone of Wings tools for all components (vertex, edge, face and object)
* Outliner
* Material Editor
* UV Editor
* SceneGraph Editor
* Integrated Renderer (Mitsuba or Lux?)
* Support for 3DConnexion SpaceNavigator

Current Status
---------------
Currently Feather is in it's very early stages of development and is pretty much useless. Once the project gets to a point where it's usable (you can open and model, make adjustments and then save your changes) I'll post instructions on how to build and install the application.
